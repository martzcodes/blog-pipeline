# CDK Pipelines Blog Series

This repo is for my CDK Pipelines blog series at [https://matt.martz.codes/series/cdk-pipelines](https://matt.martz.codes/series/cdk-pipelines).

[Part 1: CDK Pipelines Crash Course](https://matt.martz.codes/cdk-pipelines-crash-course) goes through [bin/simple-pipeline.ts](bin/simple-pipeline.ts) which creates a CDK Pipeline and a CodeBuild project that triggers on GitHub Pull Request updates.

Part 2: Creating CDK Pipeline Constructs to Improve Developer Experience goes through how to turn Part 1's code into CDK Constructs that could be published as an npm library. (Post will be published on 2/10/2022).
